# DeckHeads

(I have since restarted this project in https://github.com/SonnyCampbell/Card-Connect . I wanted to use the html canvas for the game and animations, rather than manipulating everything through DOM elements as I was doing here, but have left this up for posterity.)

A card game project I worked on, built with with React and Javascript.
